Design and implement using HTML5, CSS and JS a mock up of a single page interface for a simple web-based weather app.

The app allows users to enter and save a post code. Weather is then displayed for all post codes that have been entered.

Your submission just needs to be a static implementation (i.e. an HTML5/CSS/JS mockup) of the design. No backend work needs to be done at all.

The page should have:

an area for entering and saving new post codes
an area for displaying the weather for all entered post codes.
examples of sun, cloud, rain and snow as weather types.
Include the weather information you feel is useful to the user. We might ask you to justify this!
You are free to design the layout however you want. You don't have to create image assets from scratch however if you choose pre-existing assets the style should match the rest of the page.

Bonus points: create a 5 day forecast in addition to the day's weather for each location.
